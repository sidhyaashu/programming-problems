Java, as a programming language, does not inherently contain a specific data structure or class for representing graphs. However, Java provides the flexibility for developers to implement graph data structures and algorithms using various approaches.

Developers often create their own graph data structures using classes and interfaces provided by Java, such as arrays, ArrayLists, HashMaps, LinkedLists, etc., to represent vertices and edges. They can also utilize object-oriented principles to define classes for vertices and edges and then build algorithms around these classes.

Additionally, Java has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that provide ready-to-use implementations of graphs and graph algorithms. For example, popular libraries like JGraphT and Jung provide comprehensive graph data structures and algorithms.
