1. Tree: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. The topmost node is called the root, and each node has zero or more child nodes.

2. Binary_Tree: A tree in which each node has at most two children, typically referred to as the left child and the right child.

3. Binary_Search_Tree (BST): A binary tree in which the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.

4. Balanced_Tree: A tree in which the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one, ensuring optimal performance for various operations.

Traversal:

5. Pre_order_Traversal: Visit the root node first, followed by recursively traversing the left and right subtrees.
6. In_order_Traversal: Recursively traverse the left subtree, visit the root node, and then recursively traverse the right subtree. Results in sorted order for binary search trees.
7. Post_order_Traversal: Recursively traverse the left and right subtrees, and then visit the root node.
8. Binary_Heap: A complete binary tree where every parent node is less than or equal to its children in a min heap or greater than or equal to its children in a max heap.

9. Trie: Also known as a prefix tree, a trie is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings where each node represents a common prefix.

10. AVL_Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one, achieved by performing rotations during insertion and deletion.

11. Red_Black_Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree with the properties that every node is either red or black, and no two adjacent red nodes are allowed. Maintains balance through color changes and rotations.

12. B_tree: A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations, commonly used in databases and file systems.

13. Segment_Tree: A tree data structure used for storing information about intervals, or segments, of some linear data structure. It allows for efficient querying of intervals.

14. Suffix_Tree: A tree-like data structure used in string processing to represent all suffixes of a given string. It enables fast pattern matching in strings.
